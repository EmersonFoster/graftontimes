  <p>
    I am Nancy McFate. I am married to the most amazing man this side of the
    Mississippi William(Willie)Frederick McFate. Willie is a doctor in a town
    called Virgin in Utah. We have three children on earth and two in haven, who
    we love dearly. Will and Fred are twins and are 5 years old. Then we have our
    sweet Evie who is was just born a month ago. We lost Sarah and Jane in
    Nauvoo when they contracted Malaria from mosquitoes. Many others also lost
    loved ones as well. We miss our sweet sweet girls.

  <p>
    We just got a letter from Brigham Young calling us to settle the town of
    Grafton to grow cotton with five other families. Willie's office is next to
    a blacksmith shop. He got talking to Albert Davis who is the blacksmith and
    him and is wife got the same letter. It will be nice to have someone who
    know coming with us.

    We start packing up our house and getting it ready to sale as we wait for the other families to get to Virgin.The boys are sad that we are leaving Virgin but are really exited that the Davis's are coming as well. Will and Fred are the same age as the Albert and Betty's Youngest son Billy. Albert and Betty have six children(three boys and three girls): Bert(14), June(12), Jane(10),Sally(9),Johnny(7),Billy(5).
